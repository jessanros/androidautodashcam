### Description
This project includes software that allows your Raspberry Pi touch with a touchscreen to serve as a dashcam in the background. The software will record and  place a red blinking button at the top corner of the screen. If pressed, the user can see what's being recorded. A semi transparent floating screen 

Videos are saved as raw h264 files, and can be easily converted to .mp4/.mkv. Videos older than a given time period will be automatically deleted.

Recently added a minimalistic video player, but that is not the real intent of this project.

I recommend to use with Android Auto! I used https://github.com/f1xpl/openauto, and will be making a writeup about the installation!
