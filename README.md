# Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Dashcam


### Description
This project includes software that allows your Raspberry Pi touch with a touchscreen to serve as a dashcam in the background. The software will record in the background, and will place a red blinking button at the top corner of the screen. If pressed, the user can see what's being recorded.

Videos will be saved as raw h264 files, and can be can be converted to .mp4/.mkv easily. Videos older than a given time period will be automatically deleted.

Recently added a minimalistic video player, but that is not the real intent of this project.

I recommend to use with Android Auto! I used https://github.com/f1xpl/openauto, and will be making a writeup about it!
